<h2>Rossett News Update – 21 June 2013</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the first time for a few years the weather was kind to us so we were able to run 
<strong>Sports Day</strong> as planned. There was an excellent atmosphere with encouragement given 
to all the competitors by spectators and helped by music from DJ Jacob Dent. Some 
real resilience and determination was shown by our athletes and a number of school 
records were broken.</li>
<li>Immediately after Sports Day we hosted the <strong>Partnership Quad Kid athletics</strong> and our 
Sports Leaders assisted with the event. The Northern Area Coordinator commented 
that, out of the 400+ competitions he had organised this year, our young leaders were 
outstanding and the best he had worked with. </li>
This is just one of many events that this team have helped with this year and their
commitment is to be commended.
<li>Congratulations to everyone who took part in the <strong>Summer Spectacular Concert</strong> last
night at the Royal Hall, it was a fantastic evening showcasing some amazingly talented 
students. We were pleased that the Mayor, Michael Newby, was able to join us on what 
was a very memorable evening!</li>
<li>Monday 24 June sees the start of the <strong>new timetable</strong> which enables our students to get a 
head start on their new curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Government curriculum changes</strong> mean that more time must be given to History and 
Geography and to allow for this change, ICT has been removed as a subject in Year 8. 
However we have ensured that the Year 7 ICT course has given a good grounding to 
students in ICT skills which will be used across the curriculum in Year 8. These will then 
be developed further in Year 9 before taking GCSE ICT courses in Years 10 & 11.</li></ul>
