<p><strong>Rossett News Update – 7 June 2013</strong></p> 
<p><strong>New look for Rossett</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Why a new look …</strong></p> 
<p> · To project and reflect Rossett’s current culture</p> 
<p> · To acknowledge academic achievement</p> 
<p> · To celebrate 40 years of success (see below for more details)</p> 
<p><strong>So …</strong></p> 
<p>Now is the time to promote a visual identity emphasising Rossett’s outstanding teaching and learning</p> 
<p><strong>The benefits will be……</strong></p> 
<p> 1. An identity that represents the inclusive and diverse nature of Rossett, acknowledging that our success is created and empowered by this</p> 
<p> 2. To reflect and represent the importance that we place on a rounded education of both curricular and extra curricular activity and the broad opportunities which exist at Rossett</p> 
<p> 3. To reflect the way students and staff feel about the school and our aspirations</p> 
<p>We have already consulted with Staff, Governors, Students and a focus group of parents who were all very enthusiastic and excited about the new design as they feel it reflects the culture at Rossett. The design is still being worked on but I feel it is important to let the wider parent body see the way Rossett is moving forward. Please click

<p>Congratulations to the <strong>Year 11 football team</strong> who won the North Yorkshire County Cup beating Harrogate Grammar School 2-1 in the final on the Friday before half term. This was a great achievement by the boys and an excellent way for them to finish the year.

<p> · Alongside our own sporting activities, this week we have hosted two major <strong>primary events</strong>:</p> 
<p> · the football final for the local cluster primary schools</p> 
<p> · Sports Day, in conjunction with Harrogate Town and Sainsbury’s Active Kids, with over 150 pupils taking part from seven primary schools.</p> 
<p>Both events were hosted and organised by our Year 10 Sports Leaders and, as usual, they showed maturity and confidence in doing so.</p> 
<p><strong>Active Kids Vouchers </strong>– if you have any outstanding vouchers we would be happy to receive them as we are about to submit our order!.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations</strong> to Natasha, Ross and James Harrison; the triplets all passed their driving test on the same day – an article has appeared in the Advertiser and the Daily Mail on line:

<p>The first Saturday of the half term holiday saw parents and pupils from our feeder primaries attend Rossett on our <strong>activefamilies@Rossett</strong> event engaging in a whole range of activities. ‘<em>We just wanted to thank you and your team for organising such a lovely afternoon on Saturday. We all had a wonderful time and were very impressed by the welcome offered and the dedication of the staff of Rossett. ‘ ‘I would just like to say a big thank you to everyone George and I had a lovely afternoon being music producers and making jigsaws, also thumbs up to the PTA smashing cakes!’</em></p> 
<p>You will recall in a previous newsletter that I outlined our emphasis on full <strong>attendance</strong> to ensure good educational attainment. From September the government is introducing new legislation to ensure that schools enforce this and we too feel good attendance is an important aspect which is to be encouraged.</p> 
<p>Recently I have received requests for time off to visit the <strong>Yorkshire Show </strong>and, whilst I appreciate that this has perhaps been the norm in primary school, parents should note that students will not be given permission to attend. I will consider exceptions from farming families who are directly involved in the show.</p> 
<p><strong>Rossett 40 years on </strong>(1973-2013)</p> 
<p>We are planning to celebrate our 40 year anniversary with an extravaganza on the last day of term. The exact details are still being developed but we know we want to include memories/reflections/memorabilia of Rossett throughout the decades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Are there any parents/grandparents who have photos, memories that they would like to share to help the day be really special? If you have or would like to contribute please email
<a href="https://mail.rossettschool.co.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=b59c9e53626640eeadddecb6faa87e2e&amp;URL=mailto%3amhowe%40rossettschool.co.uk">mhowe@rossettschool.co.uk</a> and we will get in touch to discuss.</p> 
<p><strong>What’s happening next week</strong></p> 
<p> · The Samba Band are performing at the Knaresborough Bed Race this Saturday.</p>
