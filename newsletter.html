<h1>News Update – 14 June 2013</h1>
<h2><b>New look for Rossett </b></h2>
<p>Following feedback from staff, students, parents and governors we have developed the Rossett ‘R’ and this is
the final design. We will be developing new signage, web site and notepaper ready for September
when our new look is launched.</p>

<p>Parents/Guardians are warmly invited to our <b>annual Art
Exhibition</b> to celebrate the fantastic work that the GCSE and A level
students have produced this year.&nbsp; This will take place in the Art
Department on Thursday 27 June 2013 5pm-7pm.</p>
<p>A chance for a ‘de clutter’ session before the summer and an opportunity to
donate unwanted clothing including shoes to the <b>PTA Bags 2 School</b>
collection. Just drop off your bags in reception at any time and the PTA will
collect from there. We have already made over £500 this year – just from your
unwanted items!</p>

<h2>Rossett Web App</h2>
Following development over the last few weeks by Mr Cullen (ICT) and Mr Taylor (DT), I am
pleased to announce that the Rossett web app is ready for download. This
is our initial version and we are still developing the ideas. <a data-rel="external" href="http://www.rossettschool.co.uk/app" target="_blank">http://www.rossettschool.co.uk/app/</a>
<br>To our knowledge we are the first
school in North Yorkshire to develop our own app which will give parents and
students quick and easy access to information about Rossett. We would welcome
any feedback for improvements and any additions.<h2><b>Australian Visitors</b></h2>
<p>This week we have welcomed two colleagues from our partner school Kunai College in
Australia. They visited lessons, talked to staff and students. They were
particularly interested in finding out more about our innovative teaching using
mobile technologies as well as how we had introduced the 3R’s culture of
learning. 
<br>They
reported back that they were really impressed with what they saw as students
were actively engaged all the time and demonstrated excellent progress
throughout all their lessons.&nbsp; They were also impressed that students were
able to talk about the 3R’s and what it meant to them in their learning. 
<br>It was
excellent to hear that visitors had noticed this happening across the school.
